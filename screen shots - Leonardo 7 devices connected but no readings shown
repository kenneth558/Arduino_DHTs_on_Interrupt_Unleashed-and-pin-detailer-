Arduino DHTs on Interrupt Steroids Sketch

This sketch will display the numbers of all digital pins with the ports and port masks
for them, detect and display all DHT devices connected (even those on pins not
supporting Pin Change Interrupts), and detect the existence of all Pin Change Interrupts
supported by the microcontroller board and display them for you.

IT LEARNS THE INTERRUPT DETAIL BY TOGGLING PINS, so all pins must be free to toggle for
the results shown to be correct.

If you need to, you may protect pins from being tested for devices by listing them in one
of the two protected pin arrays.  The built-in LED renders its pin useless for DHT use,
so that pin is included in the list of protected pins by default and is given an alternate
function, if you need it, of being high during the duration of the device detection process.
The intent is so it can be used to control signal-gating circuitry of your design and
construction to effectively disconnect pin signals and protect driven devices from the
extraneous toggling occurring during device detection.

If you see nonsense characters displayed associated with the detection process, please
take the time now to add your board's serial communication pins to one of these
protecting arrays if you'll be using pins for serial communications.

Examining environment.  This will take a few seconds...

Note: starting with digital pin number 24 that is a duplicate of digital pin number 4, one
or more of these pins are virtual pins that are duplicates of real ones that have a lower
number, in which case a device connected to such will only show as being connected the
lower numbered pin.  Due to general Arduino memory space limitations, this sketch only lets
you know of the first one.

For this ISR ( ISR0 with PCMSK0 ), each PCMSK bit showing the pins that will trigger a pin change interrupt on it:
0: Can be triggered by each voltage toggle occurring on D17      ( port PORTB bit mask 1 )
1: Can be triggered by each voltage toggle occurring on D15      ( port PORTB bit mask 10 )
2: Can be triggered by each voltage toggle occurring on D16      ( port PORTB bit mask 100 )
3: Can be triggered by each voltage toggle occurring on D14      ( port PORTB bit mask 1000 )
4: Can be triggered by each voltage toggle occurring on D8  (A8) ( port PORTB bit mask 10000 ) and on D26 (A8)  ( port PORTB bit mask 10000 )

* = digitalPinToPCMSKbit() function reports the wrong PCMSK bit for this pin.  This software product will work around it; other software will likely not correct the report error

Factory sketch functions: enter the letter A or a number between 0 and 7 with your entire
entry enclosed between these two characters: < and >.  Entering the letter A so enclosed
will list all DHT devices each with its last 5 values obtained.  Entering the index
number of any selected device will do the same for the one device only.  Reading errors
that occur are displayed asynchronously by void loop() as they happen.
