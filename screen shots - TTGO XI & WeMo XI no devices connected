Arduino DHTs on Interrupts Unleashed Sketch

This sketch will display the numbers of all digital pins with the ports and port masks
for them, detect and display all DHT devices connected (even those on pins not
supporting Pin Change Interrupts), and detect the existence of all Pin Change Interrupts
supported by the microcontroller board and display them for you.

IT LEARNS THE INTERRUPT DETAIL BY TOGGLING PINS, so all pins must be free to toggle for
the results shown to be correct.

If you need to, you may protect pins from being tested for devices by listing them in one
of the two protected pin arrays.  The built-in LED renders its pin useless for DHT use,
so that pin is included in the list of protected pins by default and is given an alternate
function, if you need it, of being high during the duration of the device detection process.
The intent is so it can be used to control signal-gating circuitry of your design and
construction to effectively disconnect pin signals and protect driven devices from the
extraneous toggling occurring during device detection.

If you see nonsense characters displayed associated with the detection process, please
take the time now to add your board's serial communication pins to one of these
protecting arrays if you'll be using pins for serial communications.
